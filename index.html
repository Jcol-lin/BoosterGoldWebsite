		<!-- Accessability: My two accessability things are that I declared the language at the top of the code and that all my images have alts.
		
		Three SEOs: The first SEO I did was use a meta tag generator in pair with my second method of using a website that shows the data
		for people googling certain terms and plugged those into the meta tags. Along with that if this was a long running website
		I would keep researching google trends and updating those tags.
		
		Above and Beyond: My above and beyond is the shadow thing. I kind of wanted to make this website look a lot more cohesive and unified 
		than the rest of the stuff I had made. So, I used a lot of the same formatting and did the shadow thing with it which I have never done before.
		
		Ideation: Normally, I do an ideation for how I want the website layout to be where I draw a sort of mind map of the pages, what they will
		be and how they will be organized. Then, I also draw the layout of specific pages that I want to know exactly what I'm going for before I start.
		This did not happen for this website specifically as a lot of the time I was wanting to work on this one I was at my job (so I got plenty of time to brainstorm).
		
		Design: I also wanted to make a note of the design, I ran out of time to change all the color and text heirarchy but hope you enjoyed regardless.
