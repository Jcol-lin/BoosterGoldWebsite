        <p class="text-body-secondary">Michael Jon Carter was a washed-up football star from the 25th century. However, his life took a drastic turn when he was caught gambling on his own games. Determined to redeem himself and seek fame and fortune, he stole advanced technology, including a power suit and a security robot named Skeets, from a museum and traveled back to the 20th century. Adopting the name Booster Gold, he quickly became a superhero for hire, using his knowledge of future events to gain fame and sponsorship deals. Over time, Booster's motivations evolved, and he became a more selfless hero, fighting alongside the Justice League and other heroes to protect the timeline.</p>

        <h2 class="fw-bold text-body-emphasis">His Powers and Abilities</h2>
        <p class="text-body-secondary">Booster Gold's power suit, which he stole from the future, is his primary source of power. The suit enhances his strength, speed, and durability to superhuman levels, making him a formidable physical combatant. The suit also grants him the ability to fly, project energy blasts, and create force fields for protection. Additionally, the suit has advanced sensors and a computerized interface, allowing Booster to analyze his surroundings and gather information quickly.
One of Booster's most unique abilities is his access to historical records from the future, thanks to Skeets. This allows him to anticipate future events and make informed decisions, giving him an edge in battle. Booster is also a skilled hand-to-hand combatant and has received training in law enforcement techniques, making him a well-rounded and capable hero.
Despite his sometimes self-serving nature, Booster Gold has proven himself to be a hero worthy of admiration, using his powers and abilities to protect the timeline and save countless lives.</p>
